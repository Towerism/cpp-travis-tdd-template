** Requirements
- CMake 2.8+
** Instructions
*** Building
Generate the Makefiles, and then run Make:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ mkdir -p build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
#+END_SRC
*** Testing
To run tests, use the ~GENERIC_TEST~ option when configuring:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cmake -DGENERIC_TEST=ON ..
$ make
$ make test
#+END_SRC
By default, both unit and integration tests are executed. You can 
change this behavior by turning them off individually during 
configuration. Take these two configuration commands for example:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cmake -DGENERIC_TEST=ON -DGENERIC_TEST_INTEGRATION=OFF ..
$ cmake -DGENERIC_TEST=ON -DGENERIC_TEST_UNIT=OFF ..
#+END_SRC
Internally, cmake uses ctest for testing. If you would like to see
individual test case results, you can call ctest directly:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ ctest -VV
#+END_SRC
